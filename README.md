# Journal-App-EJS-Project
Hosted At: https://guarded-basin-56606.herokuapp.com/

Description:
1) The following mini-project is a demonstration of my skills using the EJS templating module.
2) The entry point of the application is the app.js file
3) The app makes use of express to render the EJS files when GET requests are made to various routes.
4) The EJS templates are stored in the 'views' folder as mandated by the module.
5) A public folder is created to store the static resources which are to be served by the express module.
6) The "/compose" route is used to compose a new post.
7) The "/" route render the "home.ejs" file when GET request is made.
8) Other routes such as "/about", "/contact",/posts/:postName are also programmed.

Drawbacks:
1)Yet to add feature to delete post.
2)The app is hosted on the heroku server and in order to clear the slate I currently have to restart the server manually. Clear list feature yet to be added.
3)Yet to integrated server to a database.
